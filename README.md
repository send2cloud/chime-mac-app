# Chime 🔔

A beautiful, native, and lightweight macOS menu bar app that subtly reminds you of the passage of time.

## 🌟 Features

- **Hourly Beep:** By default, gently plays a crisp, premium "Glass" chime exactly at the top of every hour.
- **Visual Cues:** Features non-intrusive visual cues that catch your eye without interrupting your workflow:
  - The menu bar icon elegantly pulses.
  - A sleek, floating time bubble briefly animates underneath your active cursor and fades away.
- **Custom Timers:** Need to focus? Start a Pomodoro or ad-hoc timer (`5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `60m`, `90m`, `120m`). Your menu bar icon will dynamically show you exactly how many minutes are remaining (`🔔 -37m`).
- **Completely Native:** Built in pure Swift using strict macOS native libraries (`NSWindow`, `NSMenu`, `NSTextField`). It takes up essentially 0 processor resources and fits perfectly into the system aesthetic.
